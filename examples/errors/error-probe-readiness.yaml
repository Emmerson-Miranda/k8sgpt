# Readiness/Liveness Probe Failures
# Cause: Health checks are failing, causing restarts or keeping Pod out of service.
# Fix: Validate probe URLs/ports, increase initial delay, and check app logs.
# Steps:
# 1. Check the Pod status with `kubectl get pod readiness-failure-demo`.
#    Column READY 0/1 means the readiness probe is failing.
# 2. Check the Pod events with `kubectl describe pod readiness-failure-demo`.
#    Look for events related to the readiness probe failure.
# 3. Check the Pod logs with `kubectl logs readiness-failure-demo`.
# 4. Check endpoints (if part of a Service): 
#    If youâ€™ve added this Pod to a Service, test with: kubectl get endpoints <service-name>
#    The Pod will not appear in the endpoints until the readiness probe passes.
